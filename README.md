# KDSP_PROJECT
## Inspiration
Remote-base hackathon are always a key source for showcasing one's skills and our motive was to learn through this challenge and give our best.

## What it does
the back-end of whole KDSP working flow with all features defined like recording and maintaining databases about client and other mentioned features.

## How we built it
we built the back-end on python with MongoDB database.

## Challenges we ran into
One main challenge is timing, we have built the whole back-end but we can't make it to front-end or an proper market ready app.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
All the features mentioned are completed.

## What we learned
we've learnt about time management and how one team can work in challenges like this and also we got our skills polished.
